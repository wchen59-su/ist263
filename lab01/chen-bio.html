        I am a huge foodie and I have exploring new cultures and trying out different types of food. I am a spontaneous person and always down to learn new things. I used to be a pre-med student, but then transferred into the iSchool after being exposed to technology and found a new passion for it. In my free time, you can find me playing badminton, going on long walks, cooking up new cuisines, and binge-watching Korean dramas.
