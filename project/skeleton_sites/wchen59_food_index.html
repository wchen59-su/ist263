                <p>A delicious meal does not have a cost a bunch nor should it require a store full of ingredients and utensils. My friend, a meal created from an open mind and creativity is the most exciting. I am Wendy; a college student who loves to explore through culinary arts. Despite being limited by strict dorm rules, a college budget, and limited appliances, I do not feel limited. I see as an opportunity to find creative avenues to elevate simple meals into gourmet meals. Join me along my journey of exploring different cuisines while practicing culinary arts skills I believe everyone can and should master! ðŸ˜Š</p>
